# LabFour

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/aydinardalan/LabFour/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aydinardalan/LabFour/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

he goal of Lab4 is to create a package using linear algebra formulas to handle linear regression models. It also made use of object oriented system to handle special functions such as print(), plot(), resid(), pred(), coef() and summary(). A vignette is also created on how the package can be used to conduct a simple regression analysis using a dataset included in the package. Course information and all assignments can be found at <https://www.ida.liu.se/~732A94/info/courseinfo.en.shtml>


## Installation

You can install the development version of LabFour from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aydinardalan/LabFour")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(LabFour)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
